# fcb-data-visualization

## Guided Project built through the Data Visualization Workshop by Zuitt - Tech Career Program 

### Project Description

This is a guided project that demonstrates how to build a dynamic web page that displays the top 10 trending topics on X (formerly Twitter) for the current date. The project utilizes a combination of front-end technologies and API integration to fetch and visualize real-time data.

### What I Learned

* **Front-End Fundamentals:** Applied core skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface and add interactive features.
* **API Integration:** Learned how to use the `fetch` API in JavaScript to connect to a third-party service, specifically the **Twitter Trends API by Burak** from **RapidAPI**, and handle the returned JSON data.
* **Data Visualization:** Utilized the **Chart.js** library to create and configure a bar chart, effectively visualizing the trending topics and their popularity.
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** Integrated **Bootstrap** for efficient styling and layout and **Chart.js** for powerful charting capabilities.
* **Dynamic Content:** Implemented a JavaScript function to dynamically display the current date on the web page.
